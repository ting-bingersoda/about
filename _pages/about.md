Hello, I'm Ting Mei. I am a student in Digital Humanities, exloring the intersection of play, expression and meaning. 

I believe games represent one of the most powerful expressive mediums of our time. Like writing or drawing, games serve as a channel to deliver thoughts and ideas, but with a unique capacity to combine multiple forms of expression: music, text, visuals, and—most importantly—interactivity.

At the core of my work is an embrace of chaos and humor. I view chaos not as disorder but as a field of possibilities—a space where unexpected connections emerge and conventional thinking dissolves. Through deliberately crafted moments of unpredictability, I invite players to experience the joy of discovery and the freedom that comes from abandoning rigid expectations.

Humor serves as both method and message in my games. It creates accessibility, disarms pretension, and offers a gentle entry point to deeper themes. I believe that play should feel playful—that even works addressing complex ideas can bring joy.

Though I initially approached game creation with trepidation, believing it required technical expertise beyond my reach, I've discovered that meaningful interactive experiences can emerge from simple tools when guided by clear creative vision. This discovery has been liberating, shifting my focus from technical limitations to expressive possibilities.
